# mixed-messages

This project is a random message generator allocating the user a "Game of Thrones" themed persona.
Every time it is run, the user will be greeted with a random name, profession and house affiliation.
An example would be: "Welcome! You are Aerron, a stableboy in the employ of House Baratheon.
This mesage will be logged to the console.

## Structure
There will be three arrays with message components initialized as constants:
+ Names
+ Professions
+ Houses

There will be a single function that takes an array as a parameter and returns a random array element.

Finally, the program will log a sentence to the console consisting of static parts and parts created from the function with each of the arrays as a parameter.
